# TEXTOIR HandBook

## :pushpin: What is TEXTOIR
**TEXOIR** is the first integrated and visualized platform for text Open Intent Recognition (OIR). 

We divide OIR into two categories, open intent detection and open intent discovery. Though both of them are both essential modules for OIR, they have different characteristics and implementation methods. However, there is little related work for integrating these two modules. Although some toolkits are developed for Named Entity Recognition, Sentiment Analysis, there is little related work for intent recognition, not even in open-world settings. Therefore, we build a text open intent recognition platform to fill the blank

## :couple: Audiences

* **Researchers:** With the help of **TEXTOIR**, you can quickly reproduce the open intention recognition models and analyze the effect of the comparison models.
* **New to Open Intent Recognition:** With the help of **TEXTOIR**, you can fully understand the progress in the field of open intent, and process visualization also helps you understand the model in depth.

## :house:  Overview
Our system consists of four parts, which are *Dataset Management*,*Open Intent Detection*, *Open Intent Discovery* and *Data Annotation* respectively. 
* As you can see, *Dataset Management* manages your dataset and you can do some basic operations, such as adding, deleting, modifying and searching.
* With *Open Intent Detection* and *Open Intent Discovery* you can not only manage the new intent detection models but also to train , test models. At the same time, you can analyze the models' effect. 
* We connect the open intent detection and intent discovery modules in a pipeline scheme and achieves multiple model combination. Based on the pipeline scheme, the application of *Data Annotation* is realized.
