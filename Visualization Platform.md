## :house_with_garden: Overview


TEXTOIR integrates five state-of-the-art models for open intent detection, and ten competitive models for open intent discovery respectively. Moreover, we propose a unified open intent recognition (OIR) framework, which connects the two modules in a pipeline scheme and achieves multiple model combination. These functions are called TEXTOIR Toolkit.

TEXTOIR Toolkit consists of four parts, which are Dialogue Texts,Open Intent Detection, Open Intent Discovery and Open Intent Recognition respectively.There are two main modules, open intent detection and open intent discovery, which integrates most of the state-of-the-art algorithms respectively.Moreover, we propose a unified open intent recognition (OIR) framework,which connects the two modules in a pipeline scheme and achieves multiple model combination.
